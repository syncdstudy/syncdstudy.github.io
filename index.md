## Overview
*The Problem:* ICS students often study in isolation, leading to inefficiency and weaker understanding. There are few systems that facilitate real-time, face-to-face study collaboration.

*The Solution:* Sync'd Study is a web application designed to help ICS students at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa optimize their study time through peer-organized, in-person study sessions. It enables students to easily propose and join study sessions in ICSpace. Students are categorized as "sensei" (helpers) and "grasshoppers" (learners) depending on the course.

### Key Features

Here's how it works: 

- **User Profiles:** Students log in and set up a profile that includes a headshot and two course lists:
    - Courses they’ve taken and can help with (Sensei)
    - Courses they’re currently taking and need help with (Grasshopper) Every student can be both a sensei and a grasshopper, depending on the course.

- **Course Directory:** All ICS courses are listed on the site. Within each course, students can view the senseis and *grasshoppers* (a student currently taking the course and potentially looking for help) associated with it. 

- **Study Session Scheduling:** Grasshoppers can propose face-to-face study sessions focused on a specific topic (e.g. “Help with configuration management”) and a time to meet in ICSpace.
    - Plan Ahead: Schedule a study session in advance for later in the day or week.
    - Right Now: Create a session instantly, notifying others that help is needed now in ICSpace.

- **Notifications:** When a session is proposed, senseis and grasshoppers for that course receive a notification.

- **Calendar View:** A shared calendar displays all upcoming and ongoing study sessions, along with the list of attendees.

- **Gamification:** To encourage participation, the app includes:
    - A point system, levels, and a leaderboard
    - Incentives such as gift cards for top-performing senseis and grasshoppers
    - Anti-cheating measures to ensure points are earned through meaningful interaction

- **Admin Tools:** Admins can monitor user activity, resolve issues, and ensure the space remains safe and supportive. Users can also contact admins to report inappropriate behavior.

### Goals

- Foster in-person collaboration in ICSpace.
- Encourage student interaction and peer mentoring.
- Promote safe, structured real-world study support.
