## Overview

SyncdStudy is a web application designed to help ICS students at the University of Hawai‘i at Mānoa optimize their study time through peer-organized, in-person study sessions.

### The Problem

ICS students often study in isolation, leading to inefficiency and weaker understanding. There are few systems that facilitate real-time, face-to-face study collaboration.

#### The Solution

SyncdStudy enables students to easily propose and join study sessions in ICSpace. Students are categorized as "sensei" (helpers) and "grasshoppers" (learners) depending on the course.

### Key Features

- Login and set up user profile with headshot.
- Designate courses you're a sensei or grasshopper for.
- View ICS course list, see other users involved.
- Propose study sessions (future or "Right Now!").
- Notification system for proposed sessions.
- Calendar view of sessions and attendees.
- Game mechanics with point system and leaderboard.
- Admin interface for moderation and support.

### Goals

- Foster in-person collaboration in ICSpace.
- Encourage student interaction and peer mentoring.
- Promote safe, structured real-world study support.
